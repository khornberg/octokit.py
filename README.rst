Python client for GitHub API


Installation
============

**requires python 3.5+**

Yes that is opinionated. Python 2 is near the end of the life and this is a new project.

*Note octokit and octokit.py were already taken in the cheese shop*

::

    pip install octokitpy

Documentation
=============

https://octokitpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


Examples
--------

REST API::

    from octokit import Octokit
    repos = Octokit().repos.get_for_org(org='octokit', type='public')
    # Make an unauthenticated request for the public repositories of the octokit organization

Webhooks::

    from octokit import webhook
    webhook.verify(headers, payload, secret, events=['push'])

:code:`octokit.py` provides a function to verify `webhooks <https://developer.github.com/webhooks/>`_ sent to your application.

    headers
        dictionary of request headers

    payload
        string; payload of request

    secret
        string; secret provided to GitHub to sign webhook

    events
        list; events that you want to receive

    verify_user_agent
        boolean; whether or not you want to verify the user agent string of the request

    return_app_id
        boolean; whether or not you want to return the app id from the ping event for GitHub applications. This will only return the ``id`` if the event is the ``ping`` event. Otherwise the return value will be boolean.

Authentication
--------------

Instatiate a client with the authentication scheme and credentials that you want to use.

basic::

    octokit = Octokit(auth='basic', username='myuser', password='mypassword')
    octokit.repos.get_for_org(org='octokit', type='private')

token::

    response = Octokit(auth='token', token='yak').authorization.get(id=100)

app::

    octokit = Octokit(auth='app', app_id='42', private_key=private_key)

app installation::

    octokit = Octokit(auth='installation', app_id='42', private_key=private_key)

For applications provide the application id either from the ping webhook or the application's page on GitHub.
The :code:`private_key` is a string of your private key provided for the application.
The :code:`app` scheme will use the application id and private key to get a token for the first installation id of the application.

API Schema/Routes/Specifications
--------------------------------

One can instantiate the ``Octokit`` with ``routes=specification`` where the ``specification`` is one of ``api.github.com``, ``ghe-2.15``, etc.

TODOs
===========

GitHub APIs
-----------

::

    [-] REST (see best practices, integration tests, and errors)

    [ ] GraphQL client

    [x] GitHub Apps

    [ ] OAuth Apps

    [x] Webhooks

Data
----

The :code:`octokit` client based on the available `route data <https://github.com/khornberg/octokitpy-routes>`_ and `webhook data <https://github.com/octokit/webhooks.js/blob/master/lib/webhook-names.json>`_

::

    [x] Periodically, check if ``routes.json`` has changed and if so fetch and open a PR for it to be merged

    [ ] Periodically, check if ``webhook-names.json`` has changed and if so fetch and open a PR for it to be merged

Tests
-----

::

    [x] unit tests

    [ ] integration tests - need fixtures to assert against

    [ ] coverage uploaded to code climate -- not sure why it is not working

Errors
------

::

    [ ] Raise :code:`OctokitValidationError` for param validation error

    [ ] Raise :code:`OctokitAuthenticationError` for auth error

    [ ] Raise :code:`OctokitRateLimitError` for rate limiting errors

Best Practices
--------------

::

    [ ] throttling

    [ ] handles rate limiting

    [x] pagination

Documentation
-------------

::

    [ ] Auto generated documentation

Deployment
----------

::

    [x] Deploy wheels
    [ ] Make GitHub releases work


**Check box guide**

::

    [ ] Incomplete

    [-] Partially completed

    [x] Completed

Development
===========

To run the all tests run::

    tox
